# Project-1-EDA-with-Python
Using Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib to do Data Analysis of Chocolate Sales.csv data set from kaggle.

Objective: To develop a stronger understanding of working with datasets using Python and gain hands-on experience with the data analysis process

1. Utilize Python and its libraries to clean and preprocess the dataset (e.g., converting date columns to datetime format, transforming prices like $1,000 into numeric values such as 1000.00).
2.Explore the dataset to identify patterns and relationships (e.g., analyzing the correlation between country, chocolate type, and average price).
3.Leverage tools like Pandas and Matplotlib to create visualizations that support data interpretation and insight generation.
4.Apply these techniques to formulate hypotheses and derive insights that can inform and support data-driven business decisions
